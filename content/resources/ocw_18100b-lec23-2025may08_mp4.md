    \nWe show existence and uniqueness of  first order ordinary differential equations\
    \ (ODEs). This is the Picard-Lindelof theorem and is a wonderful application of\
    \ much of the material in the class. It will use the theory of metric spaces as\
    \ well as the contracting mapping theorem. The solution to an ODE will be constructed\
    \ as a fix point of a contracting map. Here the contracting map is defined on\
    \ the Cauchy complete metric space of continuous functions on a compact interval.\n\
