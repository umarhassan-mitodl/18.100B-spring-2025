    \nWe define what it means for a function to be differentiable. We show that if\
    \ a function is differentiable at a point, then it is also continuous. We then\
    \ establish the basic algebraic laws for differentiation. Those includes Leibniz's\
    \ rule, the quotient rule, and the chain rule. Once we have that, we prove Rolle's\
    \ lemma and use it to show the mean value theorem.\n\nLicense: Creative Commons\
