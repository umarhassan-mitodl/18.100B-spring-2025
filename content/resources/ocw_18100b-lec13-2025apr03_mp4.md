    \nWe begin by giving a useful characterization of what it means for a set to be\
    \ closed. This is the notion that a set contains all its limit points.  After\
    \ that, we turn to the notion of a cover and, in particular, open covers and use\
    \ it to define compact subsets of a metric space.\n\nLicense: Creative Commons\

We begin by giving a useful characterization of what it means for a set to be closed. This is the notion that a set contains all its limit points. Â After that, we turn to the notion of a cover and, in particular, open covers and use it to define compact subsets of a metric space.
