    \nIn the lecture we show a second, more elaborate mean value theorem that involves\
    \ two functions. This is the Cauchy mean value theorem and we use it to the show\
    \ the two versions of L'H\xF4pital's rule for limits of quotients as well as the\
    \ important theorem about Taylor expansion.\n\nLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\n\
