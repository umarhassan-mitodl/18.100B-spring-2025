    \ Holck Colding\nView the complete course: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-100b-real-analysis-spring-2025/\n\

    \nWe will get deeper into some of the properties of the real numbers that we will\
    \ need and use in the class. This will include completeness in the form of least\
    \ upper bound property of a bounded subset of the reals. We will also see that\
    \ the set of rational numbers is not complete and we will therefore need a larger\
    \ set of numbers. This larger set is the reals.\n\nLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\n\
