    \nIn this lecture we show that there is way to determine whether or not a sequence\
    \ is convergent even if we are unable to write down explicitly the limit. This\
    \ is the notion of a sequence being a Cauchy sequence and has wide ranging applications.\
    \ We will also discuss some of these applications.\n\nLicense: Creative Commons\

In this lecture we show that there is way to determine whether or not a sequence is convergent even if we are unable to write down explicitly the limit. This is the notion of a sequence being a Cauchy sequence and has wide-ranging applications. We will also discuss some of these applications.
