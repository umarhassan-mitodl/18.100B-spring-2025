    \nUsing sequences and properties of sequences, we show both the extreme value\
    \ theorem as well as the intermediate value theorem. We also define the notion\
    \ of a metric space. A metric space is a space with a well-defined way of measuring\
    \ distances between pairs of points. Many of the notions that we have introduced\
    \ for the real numbers have counterparts for metric spaces and we discuss some\
    \ of those including convergence and Cauchy sequence. We will also give a number\
    \ of examples of metric spaces.\n\nLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\nMore information\
