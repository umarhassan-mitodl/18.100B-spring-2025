    \nWe show that integrating, respectively, differentiating a power series is done\
    \ by integrating, respectively, differentiating it term by term. In the second\
    \ part of the lecture we look at ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We explain\
    \ what they are and discuss what existence and uniqueness of solutions means.\n\
