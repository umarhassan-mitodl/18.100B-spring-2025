    \nWe continue our discussion of metric spaces and see that even more concepts\
    \ that we have studied on the real line have counterparts in metric spaces. Those\
    \ include, in addition to, sequences, convergence and Cauchy sequence also a ball,\
    \ a bounded set, as well as open and closed subsets.\n\nLicense: Creative Commons\
