To learn how to prove mathematical theorems in analysis and how to write proofs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02. To prove theorems in calculus in a rigorous way.\n\nThe course will start with real numbers, limits, convergence, series and\u00a0continuity.\u00a0 We will continue on with metric spaces, differentiation and\u00a0 Riemann integrals.\u00a0 After that, we will move on to\u00a0differential equations.",
